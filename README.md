## Description

This is an e-commerce website aimed to provide the direct interface between the seller and the consumer. Using this webapp, the seller can directly upload their products without the interference of any broker or middle-men, which will result in the upliftment of the profit and upraised teh sells of the seller.<br>
Now talking about the benefits for consumer includes easy search of desired product, separate profiles for each consumer with their respective login details saved in the database. This will result in faster login access and hence will provide smooth experience.<br>
Also, I have tried to maintain a good visual experience by using some of the front-end technologies. GetItHere provides separate user interfaces for the seller and the consumer.
